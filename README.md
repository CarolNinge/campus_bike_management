This is a campus bicycle management system, developed as a collaborative project.  
It includes both a management website and an app for unlocking and locating bikes.  

The account owner was primarily responsible for implementing the prediction algorithm (web) for the number of bicycles to be deployed at different locations, as well as contributing to the implementation of certain features in the app.
